# jsfmtdf

## About
This is a JS evolution of my python project for formatting python code ( https://github.com/elijahsd/pyfmtdf/ ).
I reorganized the code and used JavaScripthon ( https://github.com/metapensiero/metapensiero.pj ) to convert it to JavaScript. Took me a while to fix the mishaps of conversion, but it was pretty straightforward.
Unlike the python version this one doesn't have an internal error checker, so must be used on user's own risk.

## Usage
1. In your browser create a new bookmark, copy the content on jsfmtdf2_min.js into the URL field.
2. When editing your post, select the code and press bookmark.
